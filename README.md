# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_MYSQL_MAVEN_MARKET

Completed this project as a part of my BI with PowerBI Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

Key Highlights:

The given SQL script creates and generates schemasÂ in the Maven Market database, guarantees data consistency with date format conversions, and transfers data from a backup database. It then runs a series of queries to analyse various elements such as product costs, store-specific sales, client demographics, revenue distribution by region, returned products, and revenue segmentation depending on consumer income and membership status. These evaluations provide useful information for making strategic decisions inside the retail business model.
